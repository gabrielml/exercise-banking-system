# Banking System

## üìÅ UML Class Diagram

Before writting any code, a [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram) (Unified Modeling Language) class diagram was created to visually represent the structure of the banking system. This diagram serves as blueprint, outlining the relationships between the ```Account``` base class and its two child classes, ```SavingsAccount``` &amp; ```CheckingAccount```. It defines their attributes and methods, ensuring a clear and well-organized design that aligns with the project requirements. This planning step is crucial for developing a robust and scalable object-oriented program.
